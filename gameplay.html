                                <p class="card-text">Stardew Valley is a farming simulation game primarily inspired by
                                    the Harvest Moon video game series. At the start of the game, players create a
                                    character, who becomes the recipient of a plot of land and a small house once owned
                                    by their grandfather in a small town called Pelican Town. Players may select from
                                    several different farm types, each with a unique theme and different benefits and
                                    drawbacks. The farmland is initially overrun with boulders, trees, stumps, and
                                    weeds, and players must work to clear them to restart the farm, tending to crops and
                                    livestock to generate revenue and further expand the farm's buildings and
                                    facilities.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Players may also interact with non-player characters (NPCs) that
                            inhabit the town, including engaging in relationships with them; this can culminate in
                            marriage, which results in the NPC helping the player's character to tend the
                            farm. Players can also engage in fishing, cooking, crafting, and exploring
                            procedurally-generated caves with materials and ores to mine or creatures to
                            combat. Players can take on various quests to earn additional money or complete
                            specific collections of materials (called "bundles") to restore the town's
                            Community Center. Completing bundles rewards players with various items,
                            including seeds and tools. Completing multiple bundles grants players access to
                            new areas and game mechanics, such as a desert. All of these activities must be
                            metered against the character's current health and exhaustion level, and the
                            game's internal clock. The player can consume food that grants certain buffs
                            that is useful in certain activities and situations. Food is also a source of
                            replenishing health and energy, which allows the player to complete more tasks
                            in a given day. The game uses a simplified calendar, each year having four
                            28-day months that represent each season, and this determines which crops can be
                            grown and which activities can be beneficial. Later in the game, players can
                            restore a greenhouse and an island that can grow any crop regardless of the
                            season.</p>
