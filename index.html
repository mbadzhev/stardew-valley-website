                                    <p>Stardew Valley is a simulation role-playing video game developed by Eric
                                        "ConcernedApe" Barone. Players take the role of a character who takes over their
                                        deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place known as Stardew Valley. The
                                        game was released for Windows in February 2016 before being ported to several
                                        other computer, console, and mobile platforms.</p>

                                    <p>Stardew Valley is open-ended, allowing players to take on activities such as
                                        growing crops, raising livestock, fishing, cooking, mining and foraging, and
                                        socializing with the townspeople, including the ability to marry and have
                                        children. It also allows up to four players to play online together.</p>

                                    <p>Barone developed Stardew Valley by himself over four years. He was heavily
                                        inspired by the Harvest Moon series, with additions to address some of the
                                        shortcomings of those games. He used it as an exercise to improve his own
                                        programming and game design skills. British studio Chucklefish approached Barone
                                        midway through development with the offer to publish the game, allowing him to
                                        focus more on completing it.</p>

                                    <p>Stardew Valley was praised by critics, who highlighted the game's music,
                                        characters, and relaxing qualities, with it later being cited as one of the
                                        greatest video games of all time. Yasuhiro Wada, the creator of Harvest Moon,
                                        also praised the game for retaining the freedom that later entries of his series
                                        had lost. The game was also a commercial success, selling over 20 million copies
                                        by 2022.</p>
