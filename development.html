                        <p class="card-text">Barone aimed to give players the feeling of immersion in a small farming
                            community, stating that he wanted Stardew Valley to be entertaining while also designing it
                            to have "real-world messages". In contrast to earlier Harvest Moon games, which could end
                            after two years of in-game time has passed, Barone kept Stardew Valley open-ended so that
                            players would not feel rushed to try to complete everything possible. During development,
                            Barone recognized that some players would attempt to figure out mechanically how to maximize
                            their farm's yield and profit through spreadsheets and other tools, but hoped that most
                            players would take the time to learn these on their own. To that end, he designed the
                            cooking aspect of the game purposely not to be profitable, but instead to pay back in
                            bonuses that aided exploration, farming, mining and fishing skills. Barone also opted not to
                            include the butchering of farm animals for meat products, encouraging players to name and
                            tend to each animal individually in staying with the feeling he wanted for the game. The
                            animals cannot die but stop producing products if not tended to.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Stardew Valley originally began as a modern fan-made alternative to the
                            Harvest Moon series, as he felt the series had gotten "progressively worse" after Harvest
                            Moon: Back to Nature. Unable to find a satisfactory replacement, Barone began to create a
                            game similar to the series, stating that his intent was "to address the problems I had with
                            Harvest Moon" and that "no title in the series ever brought it all together in a perfect
                            way". Barone was also inspired by other games, including Animal Crossing, Rune Factory,
                            Minecraft, and Terraria, adding features seen in those games such as crafting, quests, and
                            combat. He was the sole developer on the game, creating all of the game's pixel art, music
                            and sound effects, and story and dialogue.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Initially, Barone considered releasing Stardew Valley on Xbox Live Indie
                            Games due to the ease of publishing on that platform, but found early on that his scope for
                            it became much larger than originally anticipated. Barone publicly announced the game in
                            September 2012, using Steam's Greenlight system to gauge interest on the game. After the
                            game was shown a great deal of support from the community, Barone began working on it in
                            full, engaging with Reddit and Twitter communities to discuss his progress and gain feedback
                            on proposed additions. Shortly after the Greenlight period in 2013, he was approached by
                            Finn Brice, director of Chucklefish, who offered to help publish the game on release.
                            Chucklefish took over many of the non-development activities for Barone, such as site
                            hosting and setting up his development wiki. Barone decided not to use Steam's early access
                            feature for development, as he felt that it was not well suited to Stardew Valley. Barone
                            spent four years working on the project, redoing it multiple times and frequently spending
                            10 hours or more a day working on it. He originally programmed it in C# using the Microsoft
                            XNA framework, but later migrated to MonoGame in 2021, which, according to Barone,
                            "futureproofs the game and allows mods to access more than 4 gigs of RAM".</p>

                        <p class="card-text">In April 2015, Barone announced he intended to release the game only once
                            he felt it was feature complete, refusing to put the game onto the Early Access program, or
                            accept any pre-sale payments. The game was released for Windows on February 26, 2016.
                            Following its release, Barone continued to work on the game, taking feedback from the
                            community and patching bugs, and stated plans to add in additional features at a later date.
                            Barone anticipated adding in more end-game content, as well as ports for other platforms.
                            Barone had stated that he initially planned a four-player cooperative mode to be released in
                            the game at launch. In this mode, Barone planned that all players would share a common farm,
                            enabling players to all do different tasks related to it, such as one player mining while
                            others tend to different parts of the farm. The multiplayer feature supports both local area
                            network and remote online connectivity. Barone had planned for public beta testing of the
                            multiplayer feature in late 2017 for the Windows version, but was still working to improve
                            the network code by early 2018. The multiplayer beta for Windows was released in April 2018,
                            with it officially launching for all PC platforms on August 1, 2018. In December 2018, the
                            multiplayer update was released for the Nintendo Switch.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Mobile versions for iOS and Android were developed with help of The Secret
                            Police, with the iOS version being released on October 24, 2018, and the Android version
                            being released on March 14, 2019. Both versions include the ability for Windows, macOS, and
                            Linux users to transfer progress to their device. In 2018, Barone stated his desire to
                            assemble a team of developers to help continue further development of the game. By 2019, all
                            versions of the game, except on mobile, were self-published by Barone. Stardew Valley has
                            also seen an active modding community, with players adding various new features to the game.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">In December 2019, Stardew Valley was added to the Tesla Arcade, a
                            Linux-based video game service incorporated within most models of Tesla electric cars. A
                            cooperative board game adaptation, Stardew Valley: The Board Game, was released in February
                            2021.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">In May 2016, Barone announced that publisher Chucklefish would help
                                    with non-English localizations, macOS, Linux, and console ports, and the technical
                                    aspects required for online co-operative play, allowing him to focus solely on the
                                    first major content update. The macOS and Linux ports were released on July 29,
                                    2016. Ports for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were announced at E3 2016 in June. At
                                    the same event, Barone stated that a port for the Wii U was also to be released,
                                    although that version was later canceled in favor of a version for the Nintendo
                                    Switch. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were released respectively on
                                    December 13 and 14, 2016. The Switch version, ported by Sickhead Games, was released
                                    on October 5, 2017.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">In early 2017, Barone stated his intentions for the possibility of
                                    a PlayStation Vita port, which was later confirmed and released on May 22, 2018.
                                    Retail versions for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are published and distributed by
                                    505 Games. A collector's edition released at the same time included a physical map
                                    of the game's world, a download code for the soundtrack, and a guide book.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">In December 2018, the publishing rights for all platforms outside
                                    of Android, iOS and Nintendo Switch reverted to Barone. This was followed by him
                                    regaining the rights for the Nintendo Switch release in October 2019, the official
                                    wiki in February 2021, the iOS release in December 2021, and the Android release in
                                    March 2022, ending Chucklefish's involvement.</p>
